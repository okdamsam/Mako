Mako is a fork of [Monolith](https://github.com/Monolith-Station/Monolith), which is a fork of [Frontier Station 14](https://github.com/new-frontiers-14/frontier-station-14) that runs on the [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Mako.

If you want to host or create content for Monolith, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.

## Building

Refer to [the Space Wizards' guide](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/setting-up-a-development-environment.html) on setting up a development environment for general information, but keep in mind that Einstein Engines is not the same and many things may not apply.
We provide some scripts shown below to make the job easier.
